     * Parking Dilemma

Description: There are many cars parked in a parking lot. The parking lot is a straight line with a parking spot for every meter. There are n cars currently parked and a roofer wants to cover them with a roof. The requirement is that at least k cars currently in the lot are covered by the roof. Determine the minimum length of the roof to cover k cars.

Example: For n = 4 and cars = [6, 2, 12, 7] and k = 3:

Two roofs that cover three cars are possible:

One covering spots 2 through 7 with a length of 6, and
Another covering slots 6 through 12 with a length of 7.
The shortest roof that meets the requirement is of length 6.

Function Description: Complete the function carParkingRoof in the editor below.

carParkingRoof has the following parameter(s):

int cars[n]: the parking spots where cars are parked
int k: the number of cars that have to be covered by the roof
Returns:

int: the minimum length of a roof that covers k cars where they are parked currently
